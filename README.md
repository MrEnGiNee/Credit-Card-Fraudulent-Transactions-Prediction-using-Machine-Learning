# Credit-Card-Fraudulent-Analysis
Welcome to our GitHub repository dedicated to Fraud Detection and Transaction Analysis üõ°Ô∏èüö¶! We aim to build a powerful fraud detection system for credit card transactions, utilizing cutting-edge code and tools to identify potential fraud cases and understand the correlation between fraudulent and normal transactions.

üîç Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Our repository includes sophisticated techniques to transform non-uniform data into uniform data, ensuring consistency and compatibility for further analysis.
Data Segregation: We have developed efficient tools to segregate Kaggle datasets into distinct categories of fraud and normal transactions, forming the foundation for our fraud detection model.
Model Training and Evaluation: Using logistic regression, we create test and training datasets by separating input features (X) and target variables (Y). Our logistic regression model is then trained to predict fraudulent transactions accurately. We rigorously evaluate the model's accuracy using unseen real-world data to ensure its reliability.
Exploratory Data Analysis: We visualize transaction class distribution, transaction amounts, and occurrence times to gain insights into transaction patterns.

This GitHub repository contains code and tools for analyzing credit card transactions, aiming to identify potential cases of fraud and determine the correlation between fraud and normal transactions.

The repository includes techniques to segregate the Kaggle datasets into fraud and normal transactions, transforming the non-uniform data into uniform data for further analysis.

To ensure effective model training, the data is separated into input features (X) and target variables (Y). Subsequently, test and training data are created to evaluate the logistic regression model's performance accurately.

The logistic regression model serves as the primary predictive tool to identify fraudulent transactions with a high level of accuracy for new, unseen real-world data. The model demonstrates impressive performance, achieving an accuracy rate of approximately 92-94% on both training and test datasets.

The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis, where visualizations are utilized to gain insights into the transaction class distribution, transaction amounts, and occurrence times. This step helps in better understanding the dataset and identifying potential patterns or anomalies related to fraudulent activities.

To address the issue of imbalanced data, under-sampling is applied, leading to the creation of a balanced dataset with an equal number of fraudulent and normal transactions. This balanced dataset ensures that the logistic regression model does not favor the majority class, contributing to more reliable predictions for both classes.

Overall, this GitHub repository provides a comprehensive approach to credit card fraud detection using logistic regression and exploratory data analysis. By leveraging machine learning techniques and data preprocessing methods, the model can effectively identify fraudulent transactions and provide valuable insights for enhancing security measures. The achieved accuracy showcases the model's robustness in handling real-world credit card transaction data, making it a valuable tool for credit card companies and customers to safeguard against fraudulent activities.
